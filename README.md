# Code Cascade

Crack the Code. Join the Branch. Climb the Leaderboard. 

## How it works

We use LLMs to generate unique puzzles for each user in the game. The leaderboard restarts every day, by the puzzles change with every invite!

# To Do
- make the invite via email functional
- create a global userbase tied to emails (when someone enters new email and username, populates a ledger so that old users don't have to constantly sign in)
- If a email is entered that is not in the ledger, sends email to new person
- if old email/username is entered, just sends notification email (max 3 per day)
- attach LLM to the backend to generate new puzzles on the fly
  - maybe first just create a random arithmetic generator, then expand to LLM based functionality for engagement
- send out daily puzzle to users via email
- make a user homepage (blocks, leaderboard, stats)
- make a dropdown (with friends emails)
- list top performers? (this could turn into spam so maybe not)
- add easy visual to understand that branching is key to getting points!
- daily leaderboard? weekly leaderboard? all time?
